A decompilation of Sonic Runners' asset bundles where the majority of in-game assets are stored and delivered over the internet.

This is a companion to the [RunnersDecomp](https://github.com/itsmattkc/RunnersDecomp/) repo and will not run without it since it shares many assets with the client. They're stored in separate repos because there are thousands of files here that can make working with the client much more unwieldy.
